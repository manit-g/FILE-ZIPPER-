### Project Description

**File Zipper with Huffman Coding** is a Python-based tool that implements file compression and decompression using Huffman coding. Huffman coding is a widely used algorithm for lossless data compression, which efficiently reduces the size of files by encoding data based on the frequency of characters. This project provides a practical application of Huffman coding for zipping and unzipping files, demonstrating how efficient data compression can be achieved in Python.

### Features

- **Efficient Compression**: Compresses files using Huffman coding to reduce file size.
- **Lossless Decompression**: Restores files to their original form without data loss.
- **File Handling**: Handles both reading from and writing to files.
- **Custom Huffman Tree**: Constructs and utilizes a custom Huffman tree for encoding and decoding.
- **Binary Data Support**: Works with binary data as well as text files.

These features make the tool useful for understanding and applying data compression techniques in practical scenarios.
